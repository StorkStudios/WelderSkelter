Colonel "Heavy Boy":\n\n"Good evening, Karl!\n\nYour task will be to weld the space junk and then to sell the resulting Scrap. You can move items around the Welding Area with the Left Mouse Button and weld them with the Right Mouse Button. To sell the resulting Scrap, press the Middle Mouse Button or S. Try to weld it together in a groups of 3 as an excercise.\n\nAnd don't forget: welding is bad for your eyesight. I highly recommend equipping your mask with Space button before using your welder. Otherwise your eyes may be quite damaged after some time..."

Colonel "Heavy Boy":\n\n"Ummm, yeah, I guess that was not enough money to buy anything from the shop...\n\nIf you want to make more money, you should weld together only items of the same type. The larger the resulting Scrap, the better. But don't get too greedy: your Welding Area item capacity is limited. And don't forget to sell it before your shift is over!\n\nAlso, did I mention that you can choose which item from the conveyor you want to get? Try moving the Item Pusher with A and D buttons to pick the item you want to have in the Welding Area."

Colonel "Heavy Boy":\n\n"Now, we also want you to create specific stuff for us, so we send you these Quests. For completing a Quest you will be rewarded with some money and sometimes also new item in the Shop, that you can purchase after the full day of welding.\n\nTo complete the quest, simply sell the item that meets the quest conditions and the reward will be granted to you. And if you are unsatisfied with your current quests, you can also just click on them to discard them and you will get some others, hopefully meeting your expectations. Pick wisely: you need to get at least 500zł to successfully complete this tutorial!"
